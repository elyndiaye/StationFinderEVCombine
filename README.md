## Brief MVVM Architecture

- Model: 
  - Structure of charging station data
- ViewModel:  
  - Handles business logic and API integration.  
  - Uses `@Published` + `Combine` properties for state changes.  
  - Annotated with `@MainActor` to ensure thread safety.
- View:  
  - Binds @StateObject to HomeViewModel.  
  - Update the UI based on viewModel changes.
